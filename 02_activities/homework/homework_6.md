**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

**Answer**: 

Reflecting on my work as a mechanical engineer in the automotive industry, in brake systems specifically, I see that while my daily decisions may not directly affect equality concerns in society at large, there are still important ethical and equity dimensions within my role. Ensuring the safety and reliability of critical vehicle systems like brakes is a key responsibility, one that is directly tied to public welfare and safety, an essential ethical concern for any engineer. Every decision I make must prioritize safety and long-term durability, ensuring that the final products we design meet the highest standards of reliability for all users.

While equity in terms of societal impact may not be as directly apparent in my work, I have had the privilege of working in a highly diverse and merit-based department. Colleagues come from different nationalities, universities, and professional backgrounds, fostering an environment where ideas are evaluated based on their merit rather than the background of the individual. I believe this diversity not only enriches the technical discussions but also helps us collectively make better, well-rounded decisions by integrating a variety of perspectives. I am proud to contribute to and learn from such an inclusive and dynamic team.

Moving forward, I would continue to emphasize the technical excellence and ethical responsibility in my work, ensuring that decisions related to brake systems and beyond, are grounded in integrity and safety. I would also continue to support the meritocratic culture of my department by championing collaboration and fostering an environment where diverse perspectives and expertise can thrive.
